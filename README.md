# Analysis on Show Up Rate at the Doctor
  * Analysis on Show Up Rate at the Doctor.docx = the final analysis report
  * RFC Doctor's Appointment.ipynb = coding file (python)
  * Appointment.sql
  * KaggleV2-May-2016.csv = original file
  * Appointment.csv = after SQL
  
 In this project, uses SQL to clean and process the dataset, implements Data Visualization with Seaborn, and then use T-Test on the A/B Testing to determine the results of show up rate at the doctor's office for this dataset.


# Identifying Heart Disease
  * Best Model for Identifying Heart Disease.ipynb = coding file (python)
  * Best Model for Identifying Heart Disease.pptx = powerpoint presentation of this project
  
  In this project, it involves Data Cleaning and Processing, using five different models to analyze the Heart Disease dataset, and then using the T-Test to determine which model is the best for discovering heart disease for this particular dataset.
